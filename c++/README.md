# Average Word
Date: 2/11/16
This is a program that reads a text file and outputs the avg lenth of the words found in the file.
A word is defined as a string of symbols followed by a whitespace, comma, period, or end of line.
The program will define a function that is called with input-file stream as a argument
The function will also work with the stream cin as the input stream

## Approach
* Introduce - cout's to user
* openfile - ask user what file and open
* calculate - count the characters and count the words divide the characters by the words to find out average word length
* closefile - close the file
* output - use cout's to output amount of words in the file and the average word legnth
* Figure out how to get this program to accept cin stream
* bulletproof
