# Reverse an Array
This is a program that takes a array of integers and returns an array with the integers reversed (last index first ect).

## Challenge
The challenge is to move all values in one array to another in reverse order

## Approach & Efficiency
I creat a new int array that is the same length as the one being passed in. Then use a for loop where i starts at array length and decrements i each pass through. On each pass through place value into new array then increment variable used to step through new array.
