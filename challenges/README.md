# Reverse an Array
This is a program that takes a array of integers and returns an array with the integers reversed (last index first ect).

### Challenge
The challenge is to move all values in one array to another in reverse order

### Approach & Efficiency
I create a new int array that is the same length as the one being passed in. Then use a for loop where i starts at array length and decrements i each pass through. On each pass through place value into new array then increment variable used to step through new array.

# Array Shift
This program will take an array and a value and insert the value into the middle of the array.

### Challenge
The challenge is to find the middle of the array and insert a value then continue to copy the original array with out loosing any values.

### Aproach & Efficiency
Space: O(n)
Time: O(n)
Create a new array that is + 1 in length from original Array. Find middle index of original array and save in a variable. Have two variable for stepping through arrays. write a if statement to catch when the middle index is reached and insert value.
