# Reverse an Array
This is a program that takes a array of integers and returns an array with the integers reversed (last index first ect).

### Challenge
The challenge is to move all values in one array to another in reverse order

### Approach & Efficiency
I create a new int array that is the same length as the one being passed in. Then use a for loop where i starts at array length and decrements i each pass through. On each pass through place value into new array then increment variable used to step through new array.

_________________________________________________________________________________

# Array Shift
This program will take an array and a value and insert the value into the middle of the array.

### Challenge
The challenge is to find the middle of the array and insert a value then continue to copy the original array with out loosing any values.

### Aproach & Efficiency
Space: O(n)
Time:  O(n)
Create a new array that is + 1 in length from original Array. Find middle index of original array and save in a variable. Have two variable for stepping through arrays. write a if statement to catch when the middle index is reached and insert value.

# Binary Search
This program will take a sorted int array and an integer and search through the array for the integer and return the index of where integer is located or -1 if integer is not found.

### Challenge
The challenge was that this needed to be done in binary search format.

### Aproach & Efficiency
Space: O(1)
Time:  O(1)
Save the first index (0) and the last index (array.length -1) in variables
add first + last / 2 to find middle
check if middle matches search integer and return index
if it doesn't match find new mid point depending on if it is greater then or less then mid point
repeat till found ? return -1 if not found

# Linked List
This library will create a linked list of int's. It will have the ability to add a new node to the head and will also have a toString method

### Challenge
Need to be able to insert a new node and be able to traverse through the linked list for the toString method and to be able to search the list for a value

#### Aproach & Efficiency
Space: O(n)
Time: O(n)
Make a Node constructor and a Linked List constructor
create a linked list with a tail and head node both set to null 
When adding to list if head isn't empty store current head in a temp var create new head node and move old head to the .next of new head
________________________________________________________________________________________

# Linked List Insertions
Need to add a method to append a new node to the end of our linked list.
Need to add a method to insert a node with a new value before a node with a value entered by user
need to add a method same as above but insert the node after.

### Challenge
To insert a new node without loosing track of other nodes in the linked list.

### Aproach & Efficiency
Space: O(n)
Time: O(n)
Append to End:
Find tail set tail.next to new Node replace tail node with new node
Insert before:
Search linked list for search value and keep track of last node
If found last node.next = new node & new node.next = current node
Insert after:
Search linked list for search value keeping next node in a variable
If found current node.next = new node & new node.next = next node

# Search from end
This method should take an integer from the user and return the value found in the node that many spots from the end

### Challenge
To search from the end only being able to traverse from the front

### Approach & Efficiency
create a size method to be able to find out the size of my list then size - value entered to know how many nodes to traverse through from the front of the list.
